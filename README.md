# Accounting AI Assistant

**Accounting AI Assistant** is an intelligent, interactive tool that processes natural language queries and provides insights over accounting data. Powered by large language models (LLMs), it transforms user input into Cypher queries for a Neo4j graph database, and supports semantic understanding and conversational AI. The app is built using LangChain, Neo4j, Streamlit, and embedding-based search techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Natural Language Querying** – Ask questions in plain language, get data-driven responses.
- 🔄 **LLM to Cypher Translation** – Converts user input into Cypher queries to interact with the Neo4j database.
- 🤖 **Conversational Chatbot** – Chat with an AI-powered assistant using context-aware, memory-supported interactions.
- 🧠 **Semantic Search** – Uses semantic embeddings to find and rank relevant documents or data.
- 🧩 **Chunk-Based Embedding** – Splits long documents into smaller chunks for more effective indexing and retrieval.
- 🕸️ **Graph-Based Data Modeling** – Models accounting data and relationships using Neo4j’s graph database engine.
- ⚡ **Easy Data Upload** – Upload your data quickly and effortlessly via the app interface.
